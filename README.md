# nba-shot-predictions

We are predicting whether or not a basketball player will make a shot using NBA player shot log data from the 2014-2015 regular season. In addition to predicting whether or not a player will make a shot, we hope to determine which features in our dataset are most crucial for determining the outcome of the shot attempt.
